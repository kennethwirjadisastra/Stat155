# Project 3


# Building the Model

Building from the analysis done in [Project 2](../Project2), we now
attempt to model out data. In this project, we build and train a
recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the temporal dependencies
between the historical temperature data and the next dayâ€™s temperature.
