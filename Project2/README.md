# Project 2


# Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a continuation of [Project 1](../Project1), where we will try
and dive deeper into the data to answer questions and find relationships
between variables.

Our goal is to predict tomorrowâ€™s maximum temperature given historical
weather data. To that end, we will explore trends in temperature, as
well as the relationship between temperature and other variables in the
data set.

All of the analysis is done in [EDA.ipynb](./EDA.ipynb)
