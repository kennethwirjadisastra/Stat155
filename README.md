# Weather Prediction Model
Kenneth Wirjadisastra

In this project, we train a machine learning model to predict the
temperature in Denver, CO based on historical weather data in the area.
The goal is to create a **sparse and interpretable model** that uncovers
the dynamics of the local weather.

## [Project 1](Project1)

In Project 1, we delimit the problem. This included introducing the
motivation behind the question and finding data. Once data has been
obtained, we must clean it before moving on to EDA in Project 2. We also
merge data from multiple locations in Denver, CO and split the resulting
data set into training, testing, and validation sets.

## [Project 2](Project2)

In Project 2, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This allows us
to describe the data and explore the relationships between variables.
The aim is to produce plots that help us answer the question of
interest: what will tomorrowâ€™s temperature be given recent temperatures
around Denver, CO?
