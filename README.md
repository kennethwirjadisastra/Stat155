# Weather Prediction Model
Kenneth Wirjadisastra

In this project, we train a machine learning model to predict the
temperature in Denver, CO based on historical weather data in the area.
The goal is to create a **sparse and interpretable model** that uncovers
the dynamics of the local weather.

## [Project 1](Project1)

In Project 1, we delimit the problem. This included introducing the
motivation behind the question and finding data. Once data has been
obtained, we must clean it before moving on to EDA in Project 2.
