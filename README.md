# Weather Prediction Model
Kenneth Wirjadisastra

In this project, we train a machine learning model to predict the
temperature in Denver, CO based on historical weather data in the area.
The goal is to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the
tomorrow’s temperature based on previous weather data in the area.

## [Project 1](Project1)

In Project 1, we delimit the problem. This included introducing the
motivation behind the question and finding data. Once data has been
obtained, we must clean it before moving on to EDA in Project 2. We also
merge data from multiple locations in Denver, CO and split the resulting
data set into training, testing, and validation sets.

## [Project 2](Project2)

In Project 2, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This allows us
to describe the data and explore the relationships between variables.
The aim is to produce plots that help us answer the question of
interest: what will tomorrow’s temperature be given recent temperatures
around Denver, CO?

## [Project 3](Project3)

In Project 3, we create a model to help us determine what tomorrow’s
temperature will be like in Denver, CO. We will build and train an RNN
in PyTorch and evaluate its performance.

## [Project 4](Project4)
