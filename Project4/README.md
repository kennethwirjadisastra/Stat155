# Project 4


# Design of Experiment

In this project, we test how the amount of missing data and the methods
used to impute such data influences our model predictions. The data is
generated by inserting missing values into the training and validation
data sets, then creating new data sets by imputing with 1) Kalman
Smoother (KS) 2) Unconditional Mean (UM) and 3) Linear Interpolation
(LI). After training a model for each data set, we test the modelâ€™s
performance on the true test data set. This process is repeated five
times, after which we can compare the test RMSE and bias.

The data generation, model training, and evaluation are all contained in
[project4_simulation_wirjadisastra_kenneth.ipynb](project4_simulation_wirjadisastra_kenneth.ipynb).
